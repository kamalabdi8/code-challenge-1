# phase-1-week-one-code-challenge
### **Prerequisite**  
1. Create a repository on your GitHub account.  
2. Use Javascript to wire down the solution.

### NB: Use o_ne folder, with 3 files for each solution. Please note that a single file should only hold one solution._

### 3. Push the solution to the above repository once done.  
4. Submit the repository link for grading.  

5. Ensure your repository has a well written README.  [HereLinks to an external site.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x2gRI9bzlKKCfQjWof7YW_AtgMfS6IUm9yV4hvrqL9c/edit?usp=sharing)  is a link to a readme template that you can use

**NOTE: You are required to complete ALL the challenges**

### **Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)  
**

Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade:

A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C - 49 to 59, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

### **Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)**

Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

**For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”_._**

### **Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)**  
Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of **basic salary and benefits**. Calculate the **payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary.**

**_NB:_** _Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below._
